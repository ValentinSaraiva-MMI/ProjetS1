                <p class="text__italic">Feminism has always adapted to its time. It is the same for its protagonists.
                </p>
                <p class="text__italic"> Therefore, the dominant figures of the movement have a multitude of different
                    profiles.

                <p class="text__italic"> And sometimes; in spite of the convergences of ideas between the various waves
                    of
                    feminism, and a gap of time that can
                    go until several centuries. </p>
                <p class="text__italic">It happens; in the history of feminism, to perceive a strong symbolic relation
                    between
                    individuals. That it passes by
                    their courses of engagement in the struggle or their more personal adventures. Despite the
                    geographical or
                    temporal
                    distance. They are naturally affiliated to each other by their past experiences.
                    The case of Ada Lovelace and Margaret Hamilton is one such case.</p>


                <h2 class="undertitle__article">Feminist and mathematics queen</h2>
                <p class="article-text">Born on December 10, 1815, to two wealthy and cultured parents. The young
                    Londoner Ada
                    Lovelace discovered her passion
                    for mathematics very early on. A passion that her mother would encourage and help to maintain,
                    despite the
                    mores of the
                    time, preventing young girls from receiving an education as advanced as their male counterparts.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text"> Following her meeting with the mathematician Charles Babbage, Ada became
                    fascinated by
                    his work on his calculating
                    machines. (We are talking here about the ancestor of computer science as we imagine it today).

                <div class="article__deco__invitation__galerie__EN"></div>


                <p class="article-text">After a complicated pursuit of mathematics due to a fragile health. Ada decided
                    in 1843
                    to devote all his work to
                    Babbage's analytical machine.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text"> Following a series of frenetic works on the Babbage machine, Ada will
                    compensate an
                    algorithm whose goal was to
                    calculate a sequence of rational numbers (the Bernoulli numbers). The resulting program will be
                    considered
                    as the very
                    first computer program in the world.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text"> Thanks to her passion for mathematics, Ada Lovelace demonstrated to the world
                    that when
                    given the same opportunities as
                    men. Women are also capable of excelling in intellectual fields.</p>

                <p class="article-text">Although she never spoke out on the subject. Her story brought recognition to
                    all the
                    female figures hidden by the
                    shadow of men, and encouraged every woman to follow what they are passionate about even in fields
                    that close
                    the doors
                    to them, making her a key figure of feminism, especially when it meets the world of science.</p>

                <h2 class="undertitle__article">The woman who landed the man on the moon</h2>
                <p class="article-text"> On Monday, July 21, 1969, more than a century after the major advances of Ada.
                    Humanity
                    set foot on the moon.</p>

                <p class="article-text"> A titanic feat that would probably have remained in fiction for a long time,
                    without
                    the help of one person.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text"> That of Margaret Hamilton, the woman in charge of developing the software for
                    the
                    Apollo 11 mission. </p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="assets/Img/image2.webp" class="article__image__Margaret" alt="Margaret Hamilton se tenant auprès du code du logiciel de navigation 
            qu'elle et son équipe du MIT ont produit pour le programme Apollo.">
                    <figcaption>Margaret Hamilton standing next to the navigation software code
                        that she and her team at MIT produced for the Apollo program.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="article-text">Since her teenage years, Margaret was infatuated with the same passion as her
                    predecessor and even went so far as to
                    obtain her degree in mathematics, giving her the right to teach this discipline. </p>

                <p class="article-text"> By refusing to become a housewife and devote her life to her husband, Margaret
                    freed
                    herself from the role that American
                    society reserved for women, and took on the role of a true feminist pioneer.</p>

                <p class="article-text"> In 1960 she accepted a position at MIT and was in charge of developing
                    meteorological
                    software. A year later she joined
                    the SAGE Project, one of the first computerized missile defense systems, and from the very first
                    days she
                    shone with her
                    extraordinary skills, successfully solving a problem that had not been solved until then. It was
                    this same
                    feat that
                    opened the doors to NASA in 1963.</p>

                <p class="article-text"> His new responsibilities were to design the Apollo program's onboard system,
                    making it
                    as autonomous and intelligent as
                    possible.</p>

                <p class="article-text"> The least we can say is that Hamilton is fulfilled by this new position. So
                    much so
                    that during her long programming
                    sessions, she often decided to bring her daughter to the office to keep her company and present her
                    programs.</p>

                <p class="article-text">It is still considered today that Margaret Hamilton laid the foundations of
                    modern
                    computing.
                    NASA will reward her in 2003 and President Obama in 2017 for her contribution to the discovery of
                    space and
                    computing.
                </p>



                <h2 class="undertitle__article"> A timeless lesson in feminism</h2>

                <p class="article-text">The similarity between Ada Lovelace and Margaret Hamilton teaches us that man
                    has always
                    been wrong to deprive himself
                    of the intelligence of women in intellectual fields. </p>

                <p class="article-text"> That when a person is driven by passion and the will to advance humanity, her
                    origins
                    had no place in the debate.</p>

                <p class="article-text">Their stories have feminist lessons that we must learn: no matter what the times
                    and
                    environments, behind every progress
                    of Man there are women.</p>
