                <p class="description"> Considered as the first woman writer of the French language who lived from her
                    pen. Christine de Pizan is not considered
                    as "Feminist" from a modern point of view, in the sense that she does not wish to upset the societal
                    system considered
                    patriarchal.
                    She wrote in 1405 la cité des dames, considered as one of the first feminist works by its engaged
                    conception, which
                    establishes the intelligence of a woman by her education and not by birth.

                <p class="description">Emblem of the French feminist movement of which she will be considered as a
                    pioneer.
                    Olympe de Gouges is the author of the declaration of the rights of the woman and the citizen in
                    which she affirmed the
                    equality of the civil and political rights of both sexes. She devoted many works to the emancipation
                    of women from their
                    husbands, including the play Necessity of Divorce, in which she asked for the introduction of
                    divorce.
                    She went to the scaffold with courage and dignity, convinced of her ideas and the advances she
                    proposed. Before her
                    execution she declared to the crowd: "Children of the Fatherland you will avenge my death".
                    She died on November 3, 1793 at the age of 45.

                <p class="description">The daughter of a judge father, Elizabeth saw early on in his office that the law
                    favored men over women.
                    That married women had no income of their own, no property rights, and no right of custody over
                    their own children.
                    Exhausted by her nation's indifference to gender inequality, she organized the first women's rights
                    convention in the
                    United States in 1848 (the Seneca Falls Convention), making her the leader of the first feminist
                    wave in the United
                    States.

                <p class="description">A woman of letters from a good Parisian family, Simone de Beauvoir distinguished
                    herself through her committed writings
                    such as "Le deuxieme sexe" (1949), making her the figurehead of the second feminist wave, with a
                    report on the
                    inferiority of women in society and avenues of reflection through new angles such as anatomy,
                    religion or historical
                    myths.
                    She died in 1986 at the age of 78.

                    responsibility of becoming the
                    godmother of the association SOS Préma, whose goal is to help children born prematurely to have a

                    growing up properly. In the same year she took the same responsibility in the feminist operation

                    goal is to improve the media coverage of women's sports.

            <p class="description"> Passionate about science and research, and endowed with an unfailing determination,
                Marie Curie did not let an
                exclusively male environment prevent her from advancing in her discoveries. At the university, there
                were only 23 women
                for 4000 students but this only motivated her to become a master in this field, as proof she was the
                first woman to have
                received the Nobel Prize and, to date, the only woman to have received two. She remains the only person
                to have been
                awarded in two distinct scientific fields: physics in 1903, and chemistry in 1911.
                Her discoveries in the field of radiation and her medical contribution during the Great War made Marie
                Curie an
                illustrious heroine of the 20th century.
                She died in 1934, sick of her discoveries but liberated from her condition as a woman.

            <p class="description">Since her childhood, Ada has used her overflowing imagination to design many
                futuristic machines.
                Passionate about the mysterious and complex world of mathematics, she was convinced that this was the
                way to build the
                future.
                But in 1820, girls were not encouraged to take physics, mathematics or engineering courses because they
                were not
                considered intelligent enough. But Ada did not let the prejudices of her time taint her passion.
                As an adult with a specialized education in mathematics, she became the first person to create a
                computer program while
                working on Charles Babbage's analytical machine.
                She died young, in pain and forgotten by history, but with the serenity of having achieved her dreams.

            <p class="description">Multidisciplinary artist since the 60s. Carolee Schneemann uses painting,
                photography, film and performance to challenge
                the archaic view of the female body, as well as the taboos of sexuality in society. She knows all too
                well that the art
                world is dominated by male codes.
                "You are a fabulous kid, you could go very far, but don't take art too much to heart, you are only a
                girl".
                Such were the words of his teacher when he understood the ambitions that nourished his student. But
                Carolee is insistent
                and will never let the world she adores exclude her for the sex she carries. She will even go as far as
                to provoke it by
                using the female body as a tool of art. She died on March 6, 2019 at 79 years, recognized and rewarded
                by her
                convictions and her works.

            <p class="description">Since 1985, Miss tic is THE feminine and feminist figure of French street art.
                She uses Parisian neighborhoods as frescoes to represent women at their strongest.
                A pride, a freedom and a power that she likes to retranscribe through her personal stories.
                Now 65 years old, Miss tic is still practicing and is even solicited by cities to design urban
                environments such as the

            <p class="description">Based in New York City where she has lived and worked since the mid-90s, AIKO is a
                Japanese street art artist who
                quickly made a name for herself in the male-dominated world of street art.
                By collaborating with titans of modern art such as the FAILE collective or Banksy, AIKO has built a
                reputation far
                beyond the gates of New York, by putting forward glamorous, powerful and uninhibited women.
                Helped by the greatest, it is above all thanks to its particular graphic style of mix between American
                culture and
                Japanese inspiration, all pronouncing current feminist convictions that AIKO will become an
                internationally known
                figure.

                co-founder of Studio Ghibli, to whom we
                owe, among others, "My Neighbors Totoro" and "Princess Mononoke", to name but a few, also uses his films
                as a medium to
                convey current social issues that are important to him, such as ecology and feminism.
                Studio Ghibli distinguishes itself from other animation studios by the importance it gives to the female
                character in
                many of its films.
                Moreover, it has gone so far as to encourage the hiring of women at the studio while ensuring their
                professional
                advancement.

            <p class="description">For some years now, the actor of Hulk in the cinema, is part of the great voices that
                dare to denounce the sexism and
                machismo present in Hollywood and claim to be fully feminist. He admits to regretting the lack of place
                of women in the
                cinema and is saddened by the characters that are given to them (often secondary, useless or poorly
                written for lack of
                interest).
                To defend the right to abortion, threatened in many U.S. states, Mark Ruffalo published on the net a
                very personal and
                committed letter, in which he recalled that abortion is a right granted in the U.S. Constitution.
