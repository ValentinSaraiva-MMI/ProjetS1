        <article>
            <h2 class="undertitle__article">The work of a lifetime</h2>

            <p class="article-text">Since the beginning of the 80's Dominique Sigaud has traveled the world in search of
                understanding of cultures that are
                unknown to her. </p>

            <p class="article-text">A former reporter, she decided to leave her job at the NouvelObs for political
                reasons
                and to devote her life to the
                study of the world, in the field.

            <p class="article-text">Her objective is to help people discover, understand and share the cultures of
                countries
                (often in conflict situations)
                that she does not understand. For her, the best way to understand a country is to go there directly and
                investigate. </p>

            <p class="article-text">Deeply feminist and humanist by nature, she decided to use her talents as a
                journalist
                as well as the culture she had
                acquired during her previous travels to write a book about the deplorable situation faced by many girls
                in
                the world.</p>

            <p class="article-text">When she wrote the first lines of her draft in 2016, she had no idea that the
                situation
                would be so serious.
            </p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2 class="undertitle__article">An informative purpose</h2>

            <p class="article-text">During his travels, Dominique Sigaud was able to collect hundreds of testimonies,
                each
                one more shocking than the other,
                so much so that for a while, his work day could not begin without systematic weeping upon awakening.
            </p>

            <p class="article-text"> His primary objective in writing this story was to open the eyes of the world to an
                unfortunate and macabre reality.
            </p>

            <p class="article-text"> A 230 page report, sincere and raw, which wastes no time in teaching us that no,
                repeated rapes, sexual mutilation and
                forced marriages are still a disastrous reality suffered by hundreds of thousands of girls throughout
                the
                world, even in
                countries considered "developed".
            </p>

            <p class="article-text"> A 3 years long ordeal so that never again, about these thousands of destroyed
                lives, we
                can say "I didn't know".
            </p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="article-text">After reading Dominique Sigaud's book, the loss of hope in any feminist cause is
                legitimate, but the disastrous
                situation suffered by its thousands of silent voices should not make us forget all the paths taken since
                the
                beginning
                of the movement.</p>

            <p class="article-text"> From the declaration of the rights of women and citizens by Olympe de Gouges, to
                the
                modern feminist movement such as
                #metoo, the struggle for equality between men and women has continued to evolve and bring progress and
                solutions to the
                future of the world. </p>

            <p class="article-text"> By letting Ada Lovelace study mathematics as an equal with Charles Babbage,
                feminism
                helped to build the digital world
                we live in today, by giving Margaret Hamilton the right to write the computer program for the Apollo
                missions, feminism
                allowed humanity to set foot on the moon, and by letting Marie Curie the right to carry out her
                experiments,
                feminism
                allowed progress in the fields of science and medicine. </p>



            <p class="article-text"> Feminism has always contributed, without us realizing it, to the great advances
                that have made the world what it is today.
            </p>

            <p class="article-text">What would be our advances today in the fields of computer science, art, sports or
                engineering... without the genius of
                women? The answer is two words: much less.</p>

            <p class="article-text">Dominique Sigaud's book is not intended to give up, but on the contrary to be an
                additional justification to the
                feminist struggle, as well as a cry of alert to the ears of the world.</p>

            <p class="article-text">Victory is still far away, but it will continue to approach as long as the fight
                continues.</p>
