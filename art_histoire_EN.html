        <h2 class="undertitle__article">The debated beginnings of feminism</h2>

        <p class="article-text">Many dates in history are likely to be considered as the birth marker of the fight
            against gender discrimination,
            subsequently designated as the feminist movement.
        </p>

        <ul class="normal">
            <li>1791: Publication of the "Declaration of the Rights of Women and the Citizen" by Olympe de Gouges.

            </li>
            <li>1830: Creation attributed of the word "feminism" to the French thinker Charles Fourrier, in order to put
                a word on the
                discriminations opposing men and women. (Origin contested with Alexandre Dumas fils, in 1872)

            </li>
            <li>1837: Entry of the word "feminism" in the French dictionary.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="article-text">But if its beginning is not fixed precisely in the History, that will not prevent
            feminism from becoming one of the most
            defended and followed fights of the History. By succeeding in gathering a multitude of causes under the same
            banner.</p>

        <!--Sous titre-->
        <h2 class="undertitle__article">The organization of a worldwide movement</h2>
        <p class="article-text">Despite the many facets of this international movement, it is possible to trace the main
            lines of the history of
            feminism through the decades.</p>

        <p class="article-text">Its beginning takes place at the end of the Middle Ages when various authors question
            the place given to women in
            society, but it will take several centuries to structure itself.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">From then on, we generally divide this movement into three main waves in which specific
            claims are put forward and in
            which certain currents take precedence over others.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">It should be noted that more and more, a 4th wave is evoked, but too recent today to be
            recognized as major of the
            movement.
        </p>



        <p class="article-text"> <strong>The first wave of feminism
            </strong>concerns the feminist movements of the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. Among
            them, the world famous "suffragets".
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">Their main claim was mainly access to social and political emancipation as well as legal
            reform, in order to improve the
            place of women in the public sector by obtaining specific rights such as the right to vote and the right to
            work.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text"> Their precise demands allowed to homogenize the movement and to reduce the appearance
            of internal conflicts within it.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text"> At that time, only a minority of people questioned the traditional roles of women.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p class="article-text"><strong>The 2nd wave of feminism
            </strong> takes its marks from the 60s to the 70s, in the United States.</p>

        <p class="article-text"> It is in its conceptualization more extreme than its predecessor because the movement
            becomes aware of the impossibility
            of a total equality between the sexes in the current system considered "patriarchal".
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">The solution is therefore to overthrow it and then build a new one, around new values
            and objectives wider than the
            first one: sexuality, family, rights to dispose of their bodies (procreation).
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">It also points the fingers on the violence made to the woman, in the home and in the
            street.</p>

        </figure>


        <p class="article-text"> <strong> The 3rd wave
            </strong> begins in the 80's, it is characterized not by a structured and precise set but by a vast set of
            political
            and artistic movements.</p>

        <p class="article-text"> It has the particularity to be carried in majority by women stemming from different
            type of minorities: prostitutes,
            transgender, racialized women, lesbians etc...
        </p>

        <p class="article-text"> The results of this wave are discussed, because in spite of the taking of confidence
            and the integration of women from
            minorities within the movement. It will have caused a splintering of the "women" identity praised by the
            previous wave.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">This could be explained by the lack of a common goal and a structured organization. This
            was the strength and unity of
            the previous waves.
        </p>

        <P class="article-text"> The feminists of the first wave were fighting for the right to vote, the second wave
            for the end of violence and
            discrimination against women, but the activists of the third wave were dispersed in a multitude of different
            struggles,
            which made it difficult to build.</p>
